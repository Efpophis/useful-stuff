Miscellaneous useful (maybe) junk

This is a collection of code I've put together from a few personal projects I've dabbled in over the years.

Please remember, this code was not written in a professional capacity, and I honestly never thought I'd be showing
it to anyone.  Therefore, it is sparsely commented and doesn't follow any coding standards other than my own
personal preference. I didn't write it to look pretty, but rather only to fulfil a purpose: to give me functionality
that I needed at the time.

I've placed readme files like this one in the different subdirectories to guide the reader through what each
bunch of code is supposed to do, what led me to write it in the first place, and other bits of (hopefully)
helpful information.

Enjoy!
